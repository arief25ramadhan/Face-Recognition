# Face Recognition and Identification using Python and OpenCV

## Description 
Use python and opencv Haar Cascade face detector and LBPH face recognizer to build a face recognition system. Create a folder containing photos of your face, if you want to test this facial recognition system using your webcam (see wheter it recognizes you!).


## Libraries

* opencv
* numpy
* pickle
* pillow
